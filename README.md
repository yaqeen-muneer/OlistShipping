## Project Overview

This project evaluates the performance of Olist's shipping partner (2016–2018). The goal is to determine whether Olist should renew, partially renew, or replace this partner based on key metrics: speed, cost, and reliability.

## Done By

## Objectives

### Speed
- Delivery accuracy and timing trends.
- Same-city vs. different-city deliveries.
- Impact of distance and product category on delivery time.
- International vs. domestic delivery performance.

### Cost
- Average freight value and freight-to-price ratios.
- Freight across distances, product categories, and weights.
- Regional disparities in freight ratios.

### Reliability
- Cancellation reasons and delivery-related complaints.

## Key Findings

- **Speed**
  - Delivery time increases with distance (7 to 21 days).
  - International deliveries mostly early (93.3%).
  - Same-city more on-time than cross-city.
  - Home & Furniture slowest; Books fastest.

- **Cost**
  - Avg freight: R$19.99; ratio: 32.09%.
  - Higher costs for long distances and lighter items.
  - Northeast Brazil has highest freight ratio (61.9%).
  - Food & Electronics most expensive to ship.

- **Reliability**
  - 46% of cancellations due to shipping.
  - Main issues: delays and logistics.
  - Few sellers/products cause most problems.
  - Satisfaction drops sharply for late deliveries.

## Recommendation

Based on the findings, we recommend a partial renewal of the shipping partnership. While performance was strong in some areas (international speed, early deliveries), there are cost and reliability concerns—especially for long-distance and certain product categories—that warrant diversification or renegotiation.

## Limitations

- Incomplete clarity on who bears responsibility for damaged items.
- Delivery status data may have inconsistencies.
- Freight pricing lacks transparency across regions and categories.
