## Objectives

### Speed
- Delivery accuracy and timing trends.
- Same-city vs. different-city deliveries.
- Impact of distance and product category on delivery time.
- International vs. domestic delivery performance.

### Cost
- Average freight value and freight-to-price ratios.
- Freight across distances, product categories, and weights.
- Regional disparities in freight ratios.

### Reliability
- Cancellation reasons and delivery-related complaints.
- Sellers and products with repeated delivery issues.
- Customer satisfaction by delivery timing.

## Key Findings

- **Speed**
  - Delivery time increases with distance (7 to 21 days).
  - International deliveries mostly early (93.3%).
  - Same-city more on-time than cross-city.
  - Home & Furniture slowest; Books fastest.

- **Cost**
  - Avg freight: R$19.99; ratio: 32.09%.
  - Higher costs for long distances and lighter items.
  - Northeast Brazil has highest freight ratio (61.9%).
  - Food & Electronics most expensive to ship.

- **Reliability**
  - 46% of cancellations due to shipping.
  - Main issues: delays and logistics.
  - Few sellers/products cause most problems.
  - Satisfaction drops sharply for late deliveries.

---

## Recommendation

We recommend a **full renewal of the shipping partnership**.  
Performance was strong in key areas such as **international delivery speed** and **early/on‑time shipments**.  
However, renewal should include improvement measures to address **damaged items** and enhance **delivery date accuracy**, ensuring higher customer satisfaction and reliability.

---

## Limitations

- Incomplete clarity on who bears responsibility for damaged items.
- Delivery status data may have inconsistencies.
- Freight pricing lacks transparency across regions and categories.
